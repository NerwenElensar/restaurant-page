# Restaurant Page :shallow_pan_of_food:

A simple restaurant page, that is surely the best restaurant around. The restaurant page exists only to practice working with webpack, npm and using ES6 modules. 

#### Learning Outcome
- Set up an environment with Webpack and npm
- Use ES6 modules to structure the project
  - Each tab is a different module
  - import/export
- JS alone is used to create the contents of the page(DOM Elements)
- CSS file for styling
